# DCL Landscapes
Decentraland Hackathon June 2019

DCL Landscapes is an an open source Library for programming virtual reality landscapes in <a href="http://www.decentraland.org">Decentraland</a> using its <a href="https://github.com/decentraland/ecs-reference">ECS API</a>. 

The library contains architectural models in gltf format created by Luke Escobar (ile#9466 on Discord) and placement and landscaping functionality in Typescript created by Mike Quest (Cyptovrontier#8787 in Discord).

<a href="http://www.cryptoquest.io:8090">Demoland</a>, our Hackathon contribution scene was created using DCL Landscapes.

With DCL Landscapes, user can create 

* Complex architectures based on its modular building blocks
* Terrains and randomized model placements, e.g. for forest 
* Animations based on rotation or an animation path
* Audio landscapes

The design philosophy behind  DCL Landscapes is to provide a modular building system which can be arranged, placed and animated in layers. Layers will typically hold the elements of a spefific theme or domain, e.g. models belonging to one building system or the terrain or a forest. 

You may try out the <a href="http://www.cryptoquest.io/dcl-landscapes/">web-based DCL Landscaper user interface</a> which will demo the generated scenes. Generated scenes can be downloaded and used in user-specific Decentraland projects by simply copying models and source code into your local DCL scene folder.

Happy building and hacking!
