# DCL Landscapes, an Open Library for programming landscapes
Decentraland Hackathon June 2019

DCL Landscapes is an open source library enabling users to program virtual reality landscapes in <a href="http://www.decentraland.org">Decentraland</a> using its <a href="https://github.com/decentraland/ecs-reference">Decentraland's ECS API</a>. 

The library contains architectural models in gltf format created by Luke Escobar (ile#9466 on Discord) and placement and landscaping functionality in Typescript created by Mike Quest (Cyptovrontier#8787 in Discord).

You may try out the <a href="http://www.cryptoquest.io/dcl-landscapes/">web-based DCL Landscaper user interface</a> which will demo the generated scenes. Generated scenes can be downloaded and used in user-specific Decentraland projects by simply copying models and source code into your local DCL scene folder.

<a href="http://www.cryptoquest.io:8090">Demoland</a>, our Hackathon contribution scene was created using DCL Landscapes.

The philosophy behind  DCL Landscapes is to provide a modular building system which can be arranged and placed as layers in a scene. Layers will typically hold a certain theme, e.g. models belonging to one building system or a terrain or a forest.
