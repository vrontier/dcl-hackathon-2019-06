# Programmed Landscapes
Decentraland Hackathon June 2019

This repository contains Mike Quest (Cyptovrontier) and Luke Escobar (ile)'s contribution to the Decentraland Hackathon in June 2019. 

We have compiled a web-based user interface in which you can try out the capabilities of the DCL Landscaper library and generate "code to go" for your very own Decentraland project. The DCL Landscaper sandbox is available on our development server http://www.cryptoquest.io/dcl-landscapes/. 

The library includes gltf models and model placement functionalities that allow to programmatically place modular architecture elements into a Decentraland scene.
