# Programmed Landscapes
Decentraland Hackathon June 2019

This repository contains the contribution of Mike Quest (Cyptovrontier) and Luke Escobar (ile). 

We have compiled a user interface demonstrating the capabilities of the DCL Landscaper library. This is accessible from our Hackathon server on http://www.cryptoquest.io/dcl-landscapes/. 

The library includes gltf models and model placement functionalities that allow to programmatically place modular architecture elements into a Decentraland scene.
